      <h2>Haikyuu!!!</h2>
      <p>
        Junior high school student, Shoyo Hinata, becomes obsessed with
        volleyball after catching a glimpse of Karasuno High School playing in
        Nationals on TV. Of short stature himself, Hinata is inspired by a
        player the commentators nickname 'The Little Giant', Karasuno's short
        but talented wing spiker. Though inexperienced, Hinata is athletic and
        has an impressive vertical jump. He joins his school's volleyball club
        only to find he is its sole member, forcing him to spend the next two
        years trying to convince other students to help him practice. In the
        third and final year of junior high, some of Hinata's friends agree to
        join the club so he can compete in a tournament. In his first official
        game ever, they suffer a crushing defeat to the team favored to win the
        tournament that included third-year Tobio Kageyama, a prodigy setter
        nicknamed 'The King of the Court' for both his skill and his brutal play
        style. The two spark a short rivalry, and after the game, Hinata vows to
        defeat Kageyama in high school.
