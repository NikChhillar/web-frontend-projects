        The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body
        gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil
        Fruit. With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the
        Grand Line in search of the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's
        ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become the next
        King of the Pirates.

        The world of One Piece is populated by humans and many other races, such
        as dwarves, fish-men, and giants. It is covered by two vast oceans,
        which are divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line; The
        Grand Line, a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line, further
        divides them into four seas: North Blue, East Blue, West Blue, and South
        Blue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Surrounding the Grand Line are two regions called Calm Belts, similar to
        horse latitudes, which experience almost no wind or ocean currents and
        are the breeding ground for huge sea creatures called sea kings. Because
        of this, the calm belts are very effective barriers for those trying to
        enter the Grand Line. However, navy ships, members of an
        intergovernmental organization known as the World Government, are able
        to use a sea-prism stone to mask their presence from the sea kings and
        can simply pass through the calm belts.
      </p>
      <p>
        All other ships are forced to take a more dangerous route, going through
        a mountain at the first intersection of the Grand Line and the Red Line,
        a canal system known as Reverse Mountain. Sea water from each of the
        four seas runs up that mountain and merges at the top to flow down a
        fifth canal and into the first half of the Grand Line, called Paradise
        because how it compared to the second half. The second half of the Grand
        Line, beyond the second intersection with the Red Line, is known as the
        New World.

        The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young man made of rubber, who,
        inspired by his childhood idol, the powerful pirate Red-Haired Shanks,
        sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the mythical
        treasure, the One Piece, and proclaim himself the King of the Pirates.
        In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy
        rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named Roronoa Zoro,
        and they head off in search of the titular treasure. They are joined in
        their journey by Nami, a money-obsessed thief and navigator; Usopp, a
        sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, an amorous but chivalrous cook.

      <p>
        They acquire a ship, the Going Merry, and engage in confrontations with
        notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out on
        their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including
        Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized reindeer doctor; Nico Robin, an
        archaeologist and former Baroque Works assassin; Franky, a cyborg
        shipwright; Brook, a skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a
        fish-man helmsman and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the Going Merry is damaged beyond repair, Franky builds the Straw
        Hat Pirates a new ship, the Thousand Sunny, Together, they encounter
        other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries,
        secret agents, and soldiers of the corrupt World Government, and various
        other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their
        dreams.
